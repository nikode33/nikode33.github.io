	My name is Logan Spong. I'm a young developer who taught themselves Python and HTML5 over the coronavirus pandemic.
  <br>
  I've always been obsessed with making things with people, for people, and for free. (and after I switched to Linux, that only got worse.)
  <br>
  While I have no offical qualifications or major projects I've been a part of; I'm very open to do requests for code and help with projects.
  <br>
  I also love old computers (As in the early and late 70s and 80s, the Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX81, things like that)
